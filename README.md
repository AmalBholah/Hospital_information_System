Install the necessary software dependencies: This includes installing Node.js and NPM on your server to manage the front-end dependencies.

Clone the repository: Once you have the necessary dependencies installed, you'll need to clone the project repository from GitHub onto your server.

Install dependencies: Next, you'll need to install the project dependencies by running the command npm install in the root directory of the project. This will download and install all the necessary front-end dependencies specified in the package.json file.

Build the application: After installing the dependencies, you'll need to build the Angular application by running the command npm run build in the root directory of the project. This will compile the TypeScript code and generate the production-ready JavaScript files in the dist directory.

Serve the application: Finally, you can serve the application by running the command npm run start in the root directory of the project. This will start a development server that you can access in your web browser.
